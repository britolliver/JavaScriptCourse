Javascript course notes

In computer science, data is anyhting that is useful to a computer and javascript provides seven data types.*null means nothing

variables allow computers to store and manipulate dAta in a dynamic fashion. It is like a box you can fill with anything.

3 ways to declare a variable in JS: var, let, const..var can be used throughout your whole program, let can only be used within the scope of where you declared it, 
const is a variable that shouldn't and can't change(you will get an error)

initialize vs declare variables
